title: The app.yaml file

An example yaml file:

    application: some-app-name
    version: 1
    runtime: python27
    api_version: 1
    threadsafe: true

    handlers:
    - url: /static
      static_dir: static

    - url: /.*
      script: blog.app

    libraries:
    - name: jinja2
      version: latest

    - name: PIL
      version: "1.1.7"

Use the name of the application already registered on App Engine:

    application: some-app-name

This is a unique name that identifies your application among all the other other web apps running on appspot.com.

    version: 1
    runtime: python27

Without the `runtime` line, App Engine does not know that your application is running Python.

    api_version: 1
    threadsafe: true

You can set `threadsafe` to *false*, but it is generally considered good practice to make it *true*.

    handlers:
    - url: /static
      static_dir: static

The `url` matches the path of an incoming request and the `static_dir` matches a static directory on your web server. The two path names do not have to be the same.

    - url: /.*
      script: blog.app

Note that the order in which these handlers appear matters. If `/.*` came first in the list, it would match all incoming requests, including `/static`.

    libraries:
    - name: jinja2
      version: latest

    - name: PIL
      version: "1.1.7"

Any libraries that you import into your application file and are not part of the standard distribution will need to be added here.
