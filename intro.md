title: "Welcome to Founders &amp; Coders"
---

_March 25, 2014_

This course is a development of _"Coding the Web"_, a six-week course that ran earlier in the year, which in turn grew out of the [Self-organising](http://selforganising.org/) study groups that ran throughout 2013. Like _Coding the web_ and like the study groups, we are going to be basing this course around online content.

But _Founders & Coders_ is not just about creating a space for you to use materials that are already freely available online. We will be creating a structured learning environment with seminars and code reviews every day, with tutorial support, and with a lot of additional content. We will also spend a lot of time working in small groups and programming in pairs.

Like any language, programming languages are best learnt by immersing yourself in them and then continuing to practice them regulary. You can learn to express yourself quite quickly, but idioms take years to master. With that in mind, we are committed to helping you develop your skills after the end of the course. We are lining up projects for you to work on, we are talking to employers to whom you can apply for internships, and we will continue to make a space available for you to study and develop your own projects after the course ends.
