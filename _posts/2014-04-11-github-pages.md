[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is an excellent way to maintain your own website and continue to get more familiar with GitHub.

[Follow the instructions on GitHub](https://pages.github.com/), set up a *"User or organization site"* using *"A terminal"*.

Add a few words of content wrapped in some HTML. If you have forgotten how to do this, go and get a quick refresher by doing [HTML Basics at Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web).

If you are feeling adventurous over the weekend, take a look at the [Jekyll Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

In this afternoon's review, we will take a look at a couple of the sites that we have just setup.

From now on, make sure that every day you make at least one change to your site. Add some content. Add some styling. Do anything that takes your fancy. A small tweak is better than nothing at all. We will review a couple of sites every day.

For inspiration, take a look at [180 websites in 180 days](http://jenniferdewalt.com/), but the important thing is not to do something amazing--just make sure that you do *something*.

You might want to make this way of working a model for how to keep your side-projects going and learning new things after this course is finished. Take John Resig's advice in his [great blog post](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).
