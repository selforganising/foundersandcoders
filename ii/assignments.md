#####[Stanford's Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)

CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.

#####[Codecademy's HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

Learn the building blocks of web development with HTML and CSS, and create your own website by the end of the course. 7 hours.

#####[Codecademny's jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)

jQuery uses JavaScript to easily build interactive websites. Learn animation, events and DOM manipulation. 3 hours.

#####[Codecademy's JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Learn how to make your websites interactive and how to build browser based games. 10 hours.

#####[Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB)

A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Make a note of any terms you do not understand (of which there will be several). We will be able to return to these terms over the course of the the next two months. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow), but don't give up until the last of the eight lectures. You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course. Up to 10 hours of viewing pleasure.

#####[Explore and Master Chrome DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/)

First two chapters only. Chapter 1: Getting Started & Basic DOM and Styles. Chapter 2: Advanced DOM and Styles. 1-2 hours.

#####[Command line Crash Course]()

You need to get familiar with the command line. We are going to be spending a lot of time on it. Also available online](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). 

#####[GitHub and Git Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyfwLX4HAxM&list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)

Follow along. Install Git. Get a GitHub account. 2 hours.
