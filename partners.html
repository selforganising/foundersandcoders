	  <h2>A letter to partners</h2>

	  <p>Founders & Coders is a new coding course run out of Collective Academy in Camden Town that is turning absolute beginners into software developers. Our pilot course has just ended and the number and quality of applications for the next cohort have been high.</p>

	  <p>On March 31st, the next course begins. Over eight weeks of full-time study, our students will be learning the fundamentals of computer science and web development using Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and even a bit of Clojure.</p>

	  <p>We are running a third course starting in June, and then in September we are scaling up to a full-time 16-week programme, which is going to take smart and motivated students as inputs and will produce smart and motivated software developers as outputs.</p>

	  <p>Thanks to the generous support of Camden Town Unlimited, our courses are free to students. Our aim is to create the best educational experience possible in a way that we hope can be reproduced elsewhere.</p>

	  <p>We are confident that over the next few months, interest in what we are doing here in Camden Town will only increase, from potential applicants, from potential employers, and from the wider public.</p>

	  <p>So, we are looking for commercial partners who want to help us develop our curriculum and to offer internships to our graduates. Your involvement will help us develop what we hope will become a benchmark educational programme.</p>

	  <p>For now, the only things we are looking for are a commitment to:</p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>Come and give a talk to our students or run a seminar on our next course;</li>
	    <li>Agree to receive applications for a three-month internship at the <a href="http://www.livingwage.org.uk/">London living wage</a>.</li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>To get more of an idea of the feel of the course, please <a href="#" data-reveal-id="video">watch the video</a>.

	  <p>There is a practical limit to the number of students we can teach and the number of partners we can work with, so please tweet me via <a href="https://twitter.com/selforganising" target="_blank">@selforganising</a> or respond to me by email to get involved.</p>
