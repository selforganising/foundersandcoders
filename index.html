          <dt>What is Founders &amp; Coders?</dt>
          <dd>It is a full-time, eight-week coding course for people with no coding experience who want to become software developers or who want to build there own software-based startup.</dd>

          <dt>When does the it start?</dt>
          <dl>March 31st, 2014</dl>
 
          <dt>Who can apply?</dt>
          <dd>Anyone over the age of 18, but we are giving priority to people aged 18-24 who live in Camden.</dd>

          <dt>What are the entry requirements?</dt>
          <dd>There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our courses require. You need to be self-motivated and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.</dd>
          
          <dt>What happens after a course ends?</dt>
          <dd>You will join our alumni network. We encourage you to keep studying. We will provide you with continuing advice and support.</dd>
          
          <dt>I want to work as a software developer. Can you help?</dt>
          <dd>Students who complete the course will be able to apply for three-month paid internships with one of a number of software companies.</dd> 

          <dt>I want to work on my own startup idea after the course. Can you help?</dt>
          <dd>Alumni of the Academy who are serious about starting their own business are encouraged to apply for membership of Collective with all the benefits that provides, including free hot-desking space, participation in the Accelerator programme and access to a wider community of fellow founders and business mentors.</dd>
