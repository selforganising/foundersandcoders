title: A couple of tools
layout: seminar

Extra tasks for today: try out these two tools. You may find it helpful to use either or both of them, instead of the Udacity code editor.

##Online Python tutor

The [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) is a great way to visualise the execution of your Python code. Use it.

##Light Table

[Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/) is a recently-released code editor that I recommend that you try out, although if you are on a Mac, you will need to have OS 10.7+ installed (and if you are using one of the white Chromebooks, it is already installed).
