These assignments are not optional. Do them before June 16th.

#####[Stanford's Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)

CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.

#####[Codecademy's HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

Learn the building blocks of web development with HTML and CSS, and create your own website by the end of the course. 7 hours.

#####[Codecademny's jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)

jQuery uses JavaScript to easily build interactive websites. Learn animation, events and DOM manipulation. 3 hours.

#####[Codecademy's JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Learn how to make your websites interactive and how to build browser based games. 10 hours.

####Optional assignments

#####[Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB)

[CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/#), a great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are *"plate"*, *"bento"* and *"#fancy"*, respectively. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there. 

A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Make a note of any terms you do not understand (of which there will be several) and can return to them over the course of the the next two months. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow), but don't give up until the last of the eight lectures. You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course. Up to 10 hours of viewing pleasure.
