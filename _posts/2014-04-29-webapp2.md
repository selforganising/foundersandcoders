####Key terms
* **webapp2** application
* **WSGIApplication** class
* **router** instance
* **RequestHandler** class
* **get** method
* **post** method
* **response** instance
* **redirect** method

Almost all Python web application frameworks use the ***Web Server Gateway Interface*** (or ***WSGI***), which handles the interface between web servers and web applications written in Python.

***webapp2*** is a simple web application framework that consists of two main parts: a ***WSGIApplication*** instance that routes incoming requests and ***RequestHandler*** classes that process requests and build responses.

#####The *WSGIApplication* object

    import webapp2

    class MainPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):

        def get(self):
            self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
	    self.response.write('Hello, World!')

    app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([('/', MainPage)], debug=True)
			
When you `import webapp2`, your application has access to the class *webapp2.WSGIApplication*. To create a new aplication you create a new object of that class.

A `WSGIApplication` object takes as its first argument a list of *routes*, which are passed to a `router` instance. Each route is defined by a *path* and a *request handler*. The path is the path of the URL that has been requested and the handler defines what happens when that path is requested.

Within an application, handlers are defined by subclassing the `RequestHandler` class, defined in `webapp2`, and most importantly by redefining the `get` and `post` methods.

All RequestHandlers contain an instance of the `Response` class, which in turn contains an instance of `out`, which in turn has a `write` method--critical for sending a request response:

    self.response.write('Hello, world')

Another useful RequestHandler method is `redirect`, which redirects output to a different path and runs a new handler, as determined by the route mappings.
