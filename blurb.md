[Founders & Coders](http://foundersandcoders.org/) is an intensive full-time course in web development that aims to give students sufficient skills to seek freelance projects, to find employment, or to work on their own web-based startup.   

There are no fees, but students are expected, over the duration of the course, to engage in a range of activities together to support their own professional development, including communicating with potential employers and clients as well as working on client projects.  

The course is offered through the [Collective project](http://camdencollective.co.uk/) in Camden Town. The first cohort graduated in February 2014 and courses are now being run regularly throughout the year. 

Course Director, Dan Sofer, developed the idea for the course after organising a series of  study groups in 2013 for his own self-directed education. His goal is to provide a first-class training at no cost to students and to become self-funding through a combination of employer sponsorship and client projects.
