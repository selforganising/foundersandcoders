title: Welcome to Cohort 3 of Founders & Coders

August 18, 2014

This is now the fourth time we have run a coding course at Collective, and we are beginning to get the hang of it.

With FAC2, which finished on August 1st, we turned our curriculum and our teaching methods upside down and we were very happy with the results. Now we have broadly settled on a curriculum based around JavaScript and Node.js, and are committed to the group-based and project-based approach that we piloted last time.

You are also likely to benefit from recent developments. We are in contact with with employers, so if you are looking for a role as a software developer, we will be able to help you. Or, if you want to continue to develop your skills with us, we may have projects that you can work on after you graduate. We also have a nascent training arm. If you think you might want to sharpen your own skills after you graduate by teaching others, there may be some options for you. And if you have your own startup idea that you want to pursue, you may find Founders & Coders and Collective a convivial place to pursue it.

The quality of applications has again been uniformly high and we have had to turn away some very good applicants, who would have previously made the cut. If you are on this course, it is because we think you are capable of getting a lot from it and of giving a lot back in return. 

We have ambitious plans and we hope that some of you will be interested in helping us develop them after you graduate.

####Meeting with you before we start

We are inviting you to Collective before we start, to set expectations, understand your learning objectives, and to answer any questions you might have.

####The groups

There will be sixteen of you starting together on Monday 15th September. We are going to assign you to one of four groups, with which you are going to stay throughout the course.

To help with the selection, we would like you to spend a couple of minutes to complete the [Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire](http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html) and send the results to [dan@foundersandcoders.org](mailto:academy@selforganising.org) before we meet.

####How to find us

We are in the basement at the back of 26 Camden High Street, NW1 0JH.

We are two minutes walk from Mornington Crescent tube. Just go through the front door of the shop and straight down the steps or call Dan on 07727 207 226 when you arrive.
