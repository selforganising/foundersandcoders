	      For now we are flying a bit under the radar, but I don’t think this is going to be the case for much longer.  I am really excited about the idea of being able to offer a first-class education on a shoestring. And this is what we are aiming to do here.</p>

	      This course is primarily about building web applications, but our curriculum adapts as it needs to. We love Python and Ruby and Clojure and Scala, but our language of choice this time around is going to be JavaScript, with jQuery on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. And we will pick up other skills, like HTML, CSS and Git, as we need them.</p>

	      <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
	      This course will stand or fall on the quality and dedication of its students. I encourage you to apply for this course. I can guarantee that you won’t regret it and it could be life changing for you just as it already has been for me.
