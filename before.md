#### Pre-course assignment

Read the *[course guide](course)*.

Note: If you have a little or no programming experience, then please *attempt all of the material below before the start of the course* and don't forget to sign up for Gmail, Linkedin, Facebook, Github and Twitter (and follow @selforganising).

Please go to _Codecademy_ and make a start on:

* [Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
* [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

And then, if you have time, work through:

* [jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)
* [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
* [Projects](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects)

The more of this material you can get through before the course starts, the less you will need to do once we get going. None of this material is essential to know beforehand, but if you are familiar with it, you will find it easier to keep up once we start.
