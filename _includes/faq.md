**What is *Founders & Coders*?**  
Founders & Coders runs the intensive full-time course in web development at [Collective Academy](camdencollective.co.uk/academy/) in Camden Town. 

**What is the aim of the course?**    
To give students sufficient skills to seek freelance projects, to find employment, or to work on their own web-based startup.

**What will I learn?**  
You will learn how to create software and build web applications using *JavaScript*, *Node.js*, and a wide variety of libaries and tools.

**How long does the course run for?**    
Eight weeks.

**Where is the course based?**    
In Camden Town.

**How often does the course run?**    
Three times a year.

**What are the hours of study?**    
The minimum commitment is Monday to Friday, 10am-6pm. There is homework, too.

**How is the classroom organised?**    
The course is project-based with 16 students working in teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews, manage projects, and edit their team's online presence.

**What are the main reasons I should take this course?**    
The skills it will give you. The quality of the learning experience. The Founders & Coders community.

**How much does it cost?**  
There are no fees.

**What's the catch?**    
The catch is that when you finish the course, we expect you to go and do something wonderful.

**If this course is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee. 

**Who is this course suitable for?**  
There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning this course requires. You need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**Are there any restrictions on who can apply?**  
Anyone over the age of 18 can apply. We particularly welcome applications from people aged 18-24 who live of have studied in Camden (who typically make up around half of each cohort).

**What happens after the course ends?**  
You will join the Founders & Coders community, which offers a growing range of opportunities for course graduates.

**Can you find projects for me to work on after I graduate?**    
Quite possibly. A number of our graduates have worked on freelance projects with us before moving on to other things.

**I want to work on my own startup idea after the course. Can you help?**  
Through the course and through our alumni network, we will introduce you to a pool of potential co-founders and developers. And we are part of [Collective](http://camdencollective.co.uk/), which offers free co-working space and access to a wider startup community in Camden.

**I want to find employment as a web developer after the course. Can you help?**    
We have a small roster of employers who have already given jobs to our graduates and are accepting applications for internships from our students.

**How long has the course been running?**    
The first course ran early in 2014 and the third cohort graduated in August.

**Who is the course run by?**    
The course is run by [*Dan Sofer*](http://sofer.com/), hosted by [*Collective*](http://camdencollective.co.uk/) and part-funded through [*Camden Town Unlimited*](http://www.camdentownunlimited.com/).
