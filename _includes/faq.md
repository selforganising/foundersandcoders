**What is *Founders & Coders*?**  
*Founders & Coders* is a community of freelance developers who love building great software. We run a free coding school, too.

**What is the aim of the coding courses you run?**    
To give students sufficient skills in web development to seek freelance projects, to find employment, or to work on their own web-based startup.

**What will I learn?**  
You will learn how to create software and build web applications using *JavaScript*, *Node.js*, and a wide variety of libaries and tools.

**How long do courses run for?**    
Eight weeks.

**Where are courses based?**    
Wherever we can find space.

**What are the hours of study?**    
Classes run Monday to Friday, 10am-6pm, but expect to study at least 50 hours per week.

**How is the classroom organised?**    
Courses are project based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.

**What are the main reasons I should take a course?**    
The skills it will give you. The quality of the learning experience. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**How much does it cost?**  
There are no fees.

**If these courses are so good, why are you offering them for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.

**Who are these courses suitable for?**  
There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our courses require. You need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**Are there any restrictions on who can apply?**  
Anyone over the age of 18 can apply, but the number of applications we receive for each course greatly exceeds the places available.

**Will I be a productive developer after the end of the course**    
We reckon that on average it takes about 1,000 hours to become a competent full-stack developer. That will take 20 weeks, working 50 hours a week. The eight-week course will give you a good foundation, but it won't get you all the way there.

**Can you help me after the course finishes?**    
If, after the end of the course, you are still serious about making a living as a developer, we will do what we can to find projects for you to work on for paying clients, but we cannot guarantee anything. We are a community of freelancers and we cannot offer employment. What we can offer is mentoring and support while you find your feet. You will need to find a way to subsidise yourself financially while you hone your skills.

**I want to find employment as a web developer after the course. Can you help?**    
We have a small roster of employers who have already given jobs to our graduates and are accepting applications for internships from our students.

**How long have courses been running?**    
We ran our first course in January 2014 for Collective Academy in Camden Town.

**Can you give me a bit more information about the course content?**    
It is subject to change, but here is a brief run-down: development environments, source control, agile development, static websites, HTML, CSS, client-side programming, JavaScript, the DOM, AJAX, APIs, server-side programming, MVC, Databases, REST, build tools, testing, data visualisation, client-side applications, product development.

**Which libraries and tools will we be using?**    
Again, it is subject to change, but here is a partial list: Git, Jekyll, Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, Node.js, hapi, MongoDB, Mocha, Gulp, D3, AngularJS.
