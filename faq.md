**What is _Founders & Coders_?**  
It is a course organised by [Self-organising](http://selforganising.org/) through [Collective Academy](http://camdencollective.co.uk/academy/).

**Who is this course suitable for?**  
This course is for you if you have little or no experience of programming and you want to learn to build web applications.

**What will I learn?**  
The [current course web pages](intro) give an idea of the structure of the course. Coursera's [Startup Engineering course](https://www.coursera.org/course/startup) is also a reasonable reflection of the kind of material we will be covering in future courses.

**How much does it cost?**  
There are currently no fees.

**I cannot study full-time. Are you offering any other courses?**  
We are concentrating on the full-time course for now, but if you want to hear about new courses, <a href="mailto:collective-academy+subscribe@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">please join our mailing list</a>. 

**Are there any restrictions on who can apply to study at Collective Academy?**  
Anyone over the age of 18 can apply. We particularly welcome applications from people aged 18-24 who live in Camden or who have recently studied at a Camden school or college.

**What are the entry requirements?**  
There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our courses require. You need to be self-motivated and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**What happens after the course ends?**  
You will join our alumni network. We encourage you to self-organise into study groups, for which we will provide advice, support, space and mentoring. We will be developing a full programme of continuing education and events, to help you achieve your educational, vocational and work goals, whatever they may be.

**I want to work on my own startup idea after the course. Can you help?**  
Alumni of the Academy who are serious about starting their own business are encouraged to apply for membership of Collective with all the benefits that provides, including free hot-desking space, participation in the Accelerator programme and access to a wider community of fellow founders and business mentors.
