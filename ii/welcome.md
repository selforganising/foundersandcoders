This is now the third time we have run a coding course at Collective, but this one is different.

Firstly, the quality of applications has been uniformly high and we have had to turn away some very good applicants. If you are on this course, it is because we think you are capable of getting a lot from it and of giving a lot back in return. 

Secondly, for the first two courses we relied heavily on Udacity's Python-based [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) and [CS253](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) for our syllabus. These are great courses--and we recommend them--but this is a course primarily about web development and for that the language of choice is JavaScript.

Thirdly, midway through the second course we started to experiment with working in groups and we liked the results. So, this time  we are going to organise ourselves into groups right from the start (and if you want to get an idea of how that might work, take a look at the work of Richard Felder).

####Meeting with you before we start

I am inviting you to Collective before we start, primarily because I want to introduce myself, set expectations, understand your learning objectives, and to assign you to a group.

####The groups

There will be sixteen of you starting together on June 16th. I am going to assign you to one of four groups, with which you are going to stay throughout the course.

To help with the selection, I would like you to spend a couple of minutes to complete the [Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire](http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html) and send the results to me at [academy@selforganising.org](mailto:academy@selforganising.org) before we meet.

####How to find us
