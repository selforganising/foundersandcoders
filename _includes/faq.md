**What is *Founders & Coders*?**  
Founders & Coders is primarily just an idea: that a good education does not have to be expensive. Collective Academy is a first attempt to realise this idea.

**What is Collective Academy**    
The [Collective Academy](camdencollective.co.uk/academy/) is a pilot project, an intensive full-time course in web development funded entirely through [*Camden Town Unlimited*](http://www.camdentownunlimited.com/).

**What is the aim of the course?**    
To give students sufficient skills in web development to seek freelance projects, to find employment, or to work on their own web-based startup.

**What will I learn?**  
You will learn how to create software and build web applications using *JavaScript*, *Node.js*, and a wide variety of libaries and tools.

**How long does the course run for?**    
Eight weeks.

**Where is the course based?**    
In Camden Town.

**How often does the course run?**    
there have been fours courses in 2014. We hope to run more in 2015, but there are nodates yet.

**What are the hours of study?**    
The minimum commitment is Monday to Friday, 10am-6pm. There is homework, too.

**How is the classroom organised?**    
The course is project-based with 16 students working in teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews, manage projects, and edit their team's online presence.

**What are the main reasons I should take this course?**    
The skills it will give you. The quality of the learning experience. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**How much does it cost?**  
There are no fees.

**What's the catch?**    
There probably is one, but we can't think of it right now.

**If this course is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
Maiinly because, thanks to the generosity of our funders, we can.

**Who is this course suitable for?**  
There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning this course requires. You need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**Are there any restrictions on who can apply?**  
Anyone over the age of 18 can apply, but the number of applications we receive for each course greatly exceeds the places available.

**What happens after the course ends?**  
You will join the *Founders & Coders* community, which offers a growing range of opportunities for course graduates.

**Can you find projects for me to work on after I graduate?**    
Quite possibly. A number of our graduates have worked on freelance projects with us before moving on to other things.

**I want to work on my own startup idea after the course. Can you help?**  
Through the course, through our alumni network, and through the wider [Collective](http://camdencollective.co.uk/) community, we offer access to a wider startup community in Camden.

**I want to find employment as a web developer after the course. Can you help?**    
We have a small roster of employers who have already given jobs to our graduates and are accepting applications for internships from our students.

**How long has the course been running?**    
The first course ran early in 2014 and our fourth cohort graduates in November.

**Can you give me a bit more information about the course content?**

**Which libraries and tools will we be using?**
